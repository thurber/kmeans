## kMeans++
###### Run a k-means statistical simulation on your data to determine clustering characteristics.
Calculations and visualizations closely follow the discussion presented [here](https://datasciencelab.wordpress.com/2013/12/27/finding-the-k-in-k-means-clustering/).

For best results, data should be normalized into a vector space with each dimension âˆˆ [ 0, 1 ] or [ -1, 1 ].

Data outside of this range will not be displayed in the visualizations.

The first row of the CSV is assumed to be header data.
